## Overview

* {doc}`leaderboards`: Leaderboards for SeaDex entries.

* {doc}`size-statistics`: Statistics about SeaDex's size.

* {doc}`unmuxed`: SeaDex entries that outline the recommended combinations for muxing to create the ideal release. Check out the [tutorial](https://thewiki.moe/advanced/muxing/) if you want to mux these releases.

* {doc}`no-comparisons`: SeaDex entries without any comparisons. Check out the [tutorial](https://thewiki.moe/tutorials/comparison/) if you're interested in making comparisons, and share them in the `#comparisons` channel on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/jPeeZewWRn).

* {doc}`marked-incomplete`: SeaDex entries explicitly marked as incomplete by the editors. They often lack comparisons or contain *useless* comparisons that need to be replaced with proper ones, though other issues may also contribute to their incomplete status.

* {doc}`public-non-nyaa`: SeaDex entries that are publicly available but not yet on Nyaa. Reposting them to Nyaa is a simple way to contribute, just be mindful of Nyaa's rules.

* {doc}`private-tracker-only-entries`: SeaDex entries found only on private trackers. You can contribute by reposting them to Nyaa, but only if the private tracker allows it.

* {doc}`private-tracker-only-torrents`: SeaDex entries with atleast one torrent found only on private trackers. You can contribute by reposting them to Nyaa, but only if the private tracker allows it.

* {doc}`public-tracker-only`: SeaDex entries found only on public trackers. You can contribute by reposting them to private trackers, following their rules and requirements.

* {doc}`top-500`: Top 500 AniList entries that aren't yet on SeaDex. If you'd like to see any of these added, your comparison submissions are needed. The [tutorial](https://thewiki.moe/tutorials/comparison/) provides a step-by-step guide. Once you've made your comparisons, please share them in the `#comparisons` channel on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/jPeeZewWRn).

* {doc}`best-missing-dual`: Best entries that currently do not have a dual audio version available. If you're interested in creating dual audio muxes for these entries, it's recommended to first join the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/jPeeZewWRn) to consult with others before starting. You can also find a helpful guide in the [muxing tutorial](https://thewiki.moe/advanced/muxing/).

* {doc}`alt-missing-dual`: Same as best-missing-dual, but for alt releases instead.

* {doc}`encode-best-entries`: Entries where an encode beats the store.
