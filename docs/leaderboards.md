# Leaderboards

These rankings are NOT 100% accurate, but they likely are as realistic as (reasonably) possible.

The definition of an entry (or a "complete" torrent) is quite murky. SeaDex defines it as an AniList entry, but every private tracker has their own definition (typically, they follow AniDB or TVDB), while Nyaa does not enforce a specific definition. Every release can quite possibly have slightly different torrents across trackers, or a single torrent on Nyaa can include several SeaDex entries. A Nyaa torrent might contain an entire franchise, but only a single file out of it might be relevant.

All of this and more means that we need to settle on a method for calculating these rankings. For our purposes, an entry is defined by SeaDex, which in turn follows AniList's definition. We iterate through every entry in SeaDex and consider a group only once per entry. As a result, these leaderboards reflect how many AniList entries a group covers rather than the number of torrents they have.

```{note}
This leaderboard is just for fun! Please don't take these rankings too seriously. We appreciate all the hard work that every release group puts into making releases. ‚ù§Ô∏è
